            <p>(This) is an effort to interact with a RESTful API, and most of it was made with React and Redux</p>
            <p>A lot of it is still in progress, so BEWEAR of me.</p>
            <p>PD: MOST of things in caps are interactable. Most. Ideally in the future everything would be.</p>
            <p>And of course, this is not even all the info the API has, only a small part, so there's that too.</p>
            <p>Redux is hard to learn, but honestly is so much better than the constant struggle with React's state.</p>
            <p>In any case, happy lurking.</p>
